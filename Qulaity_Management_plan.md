# Quality Management:
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines quality as “the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements” (ISO9000:2000). Project quality management ensures that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken.Quality management is performed through-out the project life cycle.
 
1.	Quality Planning – This was done  during the project planning process.
2.	Quality Assurance  –This was done  during the project execution process.
3.	Quality Control  – This was done  during the project monitoring and controlling process.
4.	Verification and Validation – ideally performed in all project processes except initiation.

## Quality Management Plan:

S.No|What to do | How to do | 
|---|-----------|-----------|
|1. |Identify the total quality objectives for the scope | Indentify the major requirements of the project. Identify the Optional requirements of the project later. Maintain Scope Review checklist throughout the project. |
|2. |Identify the overall quality for the triple constrains(time,cost,technology) | Identify the quality standards to  give correct techonologies  |
|3. |Identify the completeness and correctness in the deployed code| 95% defect free standards ensured, ,guideline followed , regular peer reviews and manager reviews|
|4. |Identify the best test strategy to ensure completeness and correctness in testing|Ensure the project team to perform unit testing, intigration testing, system and acceptence testing and proper evidences are provided in the testing management tool|

## Process Improvement Plan:
 The process improvement plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan. It involves the steps used to analyze different processes to identify different activities to enhance the value of the processes. Areas include particular are as following:
 - Process boundaries:It describes the start and end of a particular process as well as the outputs, inputs, stakeholders and other necessary information to being the process.
- Process configuration: it refers to the graphic depiction of the processes. It is used to help facilitate analysis.
- Process metrics: This allows the analysis of the efficiency of the processes. It also includes the use of control limits.
- Targets for improved performance: This guides the improvement activities of the processes.

## Quality Metrics: 
Quality metrics are a main part  of an effective quality management plan and are the measurements used in ensuring customers receive acceptable products or deliverables.
Following are the metrics used to measure quality:
1. Passed Test Cases Percentage = (Number of Passed Tests/Total number of tests executed) * 100 
2. Failed Test Cases Percentage = (Number of Failed Tests/Total number of tests executed) * 100
3. Fixed Defects Percentage = (Defects Fixed/Total Defects Reported) * 100
4. Accepted Defects Percentage = (Defects Accepted as valid by team/Total defects reported)*100
5. Executed Tests or Test Execution Coverage Percentage=(Number of tests run/Total number of tests to be run)*100
6. Requirements Coverage = (Number of requirements covered/Total number of requirements)*100
7. Number of bugs per test = Total number of defects/Total number of tests
8. Number of tests run per time period = Number of tests run/Total time
9. Test design efficiency = Number of tests designed/Total time
10. Bug find rate = Total number of defects/Total number of test hours

| S No | Defect Level       | Defect Name                                | Measurements|
|------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | High-Level Defects    | Not allocating work to individual group, Planning errors                           | Project Manager should have a better than average data of the partners and their abilities and dole out work in like way|
| 2    | Mid-level Defects     | Bugs, Integration issues                                      | Exactly when modules are united together and attempted on a whole a couple issues may develop so the testing gathering should have enough learning of the extensive number of modules|                                          
| 3    | Low-level Defects     | Hard-disk specifications                         | Screen resolution of the PCs are not be a tremendous issue but instead work should be conceivable better if it is as per the particulars|

## Quality Tools:
- The following are examples of tools that can be used to support quality management implementation
Benchmarking :Benchmarking generates ideas for quality improvements by comparing specific project practices or product characteristics to those of other projects or products within or outside the performing organization. 

- Cause-and-effect diagram: 
Also called Ishikawa or fishbone chart: Identifies many possible causes for an effect or problem and sorts ideas into useful categories.

- Check sheet: A structured, prepared form for collecting and analyzing data; a generic tool that can be adapted for a wide variety of purposes.

- Control charts: Graphs used to study how a process changes over time. Comparing current data to historical control limits leads to conclusions about whether the process variation is consistent (in control) or is unpredictable (out of control, affected by special causes of variation).

- Histogram: The most commonly used graph for showing frequency distributions, or how often each different value in a set of data occurs.
-  Pareto chart:  It Shows on a bar graph which factors are more significant.

-  Scatter diagram: 
Scatter diagram is a  Graphs pairs of numerical data, one variable on each axis, to look for a relationship.
-  Stratification: 
It is a  technique that separates data gathered from a variety of sources so that patterns can be seen
